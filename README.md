# AI-RAG

A beginner-friendly AI Document Chat project built one day at a time.

## Day 1: Text Extraction

Goal: read a local document and print its raw text in the console.

Supported today:

- `.txt`
- `.md`
- `.pdf` after installing `pypdf`

Run the sample:

```powershell
cd "F:\AI Project\AI-RAG"
python backend/main.py sample_docs/day1.txt --show-text
```

Run your own text or Markdown file:

```powershell
python backend/main.py path\to\your-file.txt --show-text
```

For PDF support:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend/main.py path\to\your-file.pdf
```

## Day 2: Chunking

Goal: split extracted text into smaller overlapping chunks.

Run the Day 2 sample:

```powershell
python backend/main.py sample_docs/day2_long.txt --chunk-size 600 --overlap 120
```

Show the full extracted text before the chunks:

```powershell
python backend/main.py sample_docs/day2_long.txt --show-text
```

Why chunks matter:

- LLMs and embedding models work better with smaller text pieces.
- Search needs focused passages, not one giant document.
- Overlap keeps important sentences from getting lost between chunk boundaries.
